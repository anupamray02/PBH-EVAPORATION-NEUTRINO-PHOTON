# PBH-EVAPORATION-NEUTRINO-POSITRON
Probing ultralight PBHs as DM from neutrino and positron emission

Ultralight evaporating PBHs in the mass range of 10^{15} -- 10^{17} g is a viable DM candidate. We probe this mass window by searching their Hawking evaporated neutrinos and positrons via DSNB searches at Super-Kamiokande and recent measurement of the 511 keV gamma-ray line flux by INTEGRAL. We provide stringent exclusions on ultralight PBHs as DM from non-observations of such Hawking emitted partciles in those searches. The constraints probe much higher mass windows for PBHs that have rotation or which follow an extended mass distribution,
